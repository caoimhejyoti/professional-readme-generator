## Description
This project was created to speed up my creation of README files for my projects. By creating this CLI project I am now able to create a README file to my template easily and quickly using CL prompts. 

With this project I was interesting in developing the following skills:
1. NodeJS
2. CLI
3. NPM
4. AXIOS
5. INQUIRER
6. Working across multiple JavaScript files.

## Installation
This program opporates from your command line interface(CLI). First navigate to the application directory. Then run the following commands:

```bash
npm init
npm install inquirer@8.2.4
```

## Usage
Once fully installed, this program is invoked with the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
Once the application successfully created the README file, the file will be stored in the Develop folder.

To see this program in opperation, watch our live demo!

## Future Developments
1. Look at making the table of contents populate based on user input.
2. Develop styling to include colours within the CLI
